# NANTA * Not A Note Taking App

### Features and flags

```bash
note new --title "Todos" # To specify a title
note edit # Opens the last created note in your specified editor
```

### Suggested aliases

Here are some suggestions that I have in mind, will make the experience better. It's also easier to remember if you think of them this way:

- `ne` -> note edit
- `nn` -> new note

```bash
alias ne="nanta edit"
alias nn="nanta new --title"
```

### Configuration

The configuration is quite simple, it only contains 3 parameters. This is the default configuration that I use:

```yaml
# Change <user> with your username (or output of echo $USER)
notes_dir: "/home/<user>/notes" 
modifier: "nvim" # I use neovim, but tbf you can put anything here, like <code> for vscode
template: "/home/<user>/.config/nanta/templates/default.tmpl"
```

This configuration is autogenerated if you install it via the installation script, and it will autocomplete to these defaults, no need to edit anything.

### Template

The template can be found at the path mentioned in the configuration. This is the default template used:

```markdown
# {{.Title}}

Time: {{.Timestamp}}

---

- [] xxxx
- [] xxxx
- [] xxxx
```

The lower part of the template represents tasks, I usually try to break a task in smaller chunks, and timestamp the time needed for each of those, for example:

```markdown
# Example

Time: 2025-06-09 14:15

---

- [x] 25:40  Task 1
- [x] 116:40 Task 2 
- [] xxxx    Task 3

---

# Notes

### Task1

### Task2

### Task3

### Whatever note
```

### TODOs

- [x] Refactor some of the code, it's pretty coupled as is right now
- [x] Control flow should be better for commands
- [x] Use a modern cli package
