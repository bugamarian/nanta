# NANTA * Not A Note Taking App

### Features and flags

```bash
note --title "Todos" # To specify a title
note --template "/home/user/yourpath/template.md" # Specify a custom template
note --last # Opens the last created note
note --no-editor # Just creates the file without opening the editor
note --config "/home/user/yourpath/config.yaml" # Specify a custom location for config| config file MUST be a YAML file.
note --preview # Works only if --last is provided, will print the path to the file so you can pipe it in another program
```

### Suggested aliases

Here are some suggestions that I have in mind, will make the experience better. It's also easier to remember if you think of them this way:


- `lkn` -> last known note # Using `lkn` because `ln` is reserverd
- `lnp`-> last note preview
- `nn` -> new note



```bash
alias ln="nanta --last"
alias lnp="nanta --last --preview"
alias nn="nanta --title"
```

### Configuration

The configuration is quite simple, it only contains 4 parameters. This is the default configuration that I use:

```yaml
notes_dir: "./home/<user>/notes" # Change <user> with your username (or output of echo $USER)
savemode: "daily" # can also use "timestamp", where timestamp includes the hours and minutes
editor: "nvim" # I use neovim, but tbf you can put anything here, like <code> for vscode
previewer: "glow" # I use glow to preview the document in the terminal. Could also use <cat> or <bat>
```

This configuration is autogenerated if you install it via the installation script, and it will autocomplete to these defaults, no need to edit anything.


### TODOs

1. Refactor some of the code, it's pretty coupled as is right now
2. Control flow should be better for commands
