# NANTA * Not A Note Taking App

### Features and flags

```bash
note new --title "Todos" # To specify a title
note edit # Opens the last created note in your specified editor
```

### Suggested aliases

Here are some suggestions that I have in mind, will make the experience better. It's also easier to remember if you think of them this way:


- `ne` -> note edit
- `nn` -> new note



```bash
alias ne="nanta edit"
alias nn="nanta new --title"
```

### Configuration

The configuration is quite simple, it only contains 4 parameters. This is the default configuration that I use:

```yaml
notes_dir: "./home/<user>/notes" # Change <user> with your username (or output of echo $USER)
modifier: "nvim" # I use neovim, but tbf you can put anything here, like <code> for vscode
```
template: "./home/<user>/.config/nanta/templates/default.tmpl"

This configuration is autogenerated if you install it via the installation script, and it will autocomplete to these defaults, no need to edit anything.


### TODOs

- [x] Refactor some of the code, it's pretty coupled as is right now
- [x] Control flow should be better for commands
- [x] Use a modern cli package
